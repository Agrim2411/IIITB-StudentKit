## Innovation Studio

Innovation Studio is a student body, which was formalized in Feb, 2017, with the guidance of IIITB Innovation Center and IIITB Faculty.


We started with an aim to foster creative thinking to deliver products that the society needs. We want to develop an ecosystem which provides students with a necessary platform to realize their ideas by utilizing the guidance provided by our faculty, alumni and the strong network of IIITB.


Our motto is to promote informal learning and unleash the latent technical and entrepreneurial spirit of IIITB.

## Music Club

Music club, as the name suggests, is pretty straightforward in its aims and objectives. If you are a singer, an instrumentalist or just a music enthusiast, you are welcome to join us.

Music club has been around for as long as the college has.We have had amazing people, with incredible passion and talent, enthrall us with their awesomeness.

We organise musical nights, where everyone who's part of the club (and others if time permits) get to perform. People in the club also get opportunities to be part of IIITB Foundation day, infin8, Spandan and convocation.

Being a part of the club is a wonderful opportunity to meet people equally passionate as you, people with varied tastes in music and people who might give you a new perspective in the way you look at music. Those late night jamming sessions and musical nights will be totally worth the time you invest.

## Comic Club

People of the world unite! Gather around and share creativity! There's no better way to spend your time than with your favorite TV, movie and manga characters! And hence, The Comic Club was formed. Since our inception, we have made some fantastic comic strips which have been published in 8bit, organized Graffiti walls every now and then so that students can showcase their talent on an open platform. We have been conducting League of Fanatics in the infin8 which is considered as one of the most anticipated events at IIITB. Not to forget those nights when we sat down for hours discussing anime, mangas, movies etc. So, if you also share the same interests then...
Hop in, unleash your creativity and let's have a great time together...

## Cite.

And do not discount on the fun part, our little chats on Sci-Fi movies, music trends, anime etc. will surely act as a stressbuster. Make way for all kinds of discussions, even the crude ones. It will make way for sophisticated ones….
REMEMBER: It never starts with a sophisticated one!!!

## Aikyam

Aikyam is the social wing of IIITB that was started in 2008 by the students of IIITB. It is an initiative taken to help the poor and the needy.

What we do as part of Aikyam is, plan ‘Aikyam Trips’ to visit orphanages occasionally and spend our day with the children there. We usually collect funds from the students in college before any trip. We buy the necessary items for the children there and also give the funds collected to the orphanage. We generally visit the ‘Desire Society’ - which is the home for HIV-affected kids (aged between 3-15) and ‘Swanthana’ - which is the home for mentally and physically challenged girls.

Apart from this, we collect articles like clothes, food and books from the students and donate them to the needy. For example, last year on Eid, we collected these articles and donated them to the Goonj society at Electronic City.

Also, we conduct activities in college to spread social awareness among the students. For example, we started two initiatives last year - The Little Things and The Tiny Tales. The Little Things is an initiative where the students make a short video to convey their concern to protect the environment or to support a social cause. The Tiny Tales is another such event where the students write a line or two on what they think they can do for the society.

And we organise events to raise funds for donation. One such event is putting up a lemonade stall during the college fest.

We also help in organising blood donation camps at our college.

Why we do all this is because we believe that ‘Unity is the secret of social progress, and service to society is the means to promote it’. By all this, we spread happiness to other people (like the orphans and the needy) and also realise how fortunate we are. This is the place where we can do something good and useful for the society and be thankful for all that we have.  

We look forward to join more hands in doing something useful to make our society a happier place to live in.

## 8Bit

8Bit is the official magazine of IIITB. It is an entirely student-run club, where they are the solely in-charge of the content, editing and structure of the magazine.

The magazine provides a creative outlet for all your thoughts, artistic endeavors, humor etc.

The best part about 8Bit is that, that it is not limited to a specific type of content and has a place for everyone, whether you are a designer, artist, writer, editor, poet or just a social person who wants to know people by talking or interviewing them.

Here at 8Bit, the bonds are formed over lively discussion sessions and late night editing and designing marathons.
So join us for a different take in an IT college, to give you a break and let you explore your lesser known interests.
