## Innovation Studio

Innovation Studio is a student body, which was formalized in Feb, 2017, with the guidance of IIITB Innovation Center and IIITB Faculty.

We started with an aim to foster creative thinking to deliver products that the society needs. We want to develop an ecosystem which provides students with a necessary platform to realize their ideas by utilizing the guidance provided by our faculty, alumni and the strong network of IIITB.

Our motto is to promote informal learning and unleash the latent technical and entrepreneurial spirit of IIITB.

## Music Club

Music club, as the name suggests, is pretty straightforward in its aims and objectives. If you are a singer, an instrumentalist or just a music enthusiast, you are welcome to join us.

Music club has been around for as long as the college has.We have had amazing people, with incredible passion and talent, enthrall us with their awesomeness.

We organise musical nights, where everyone who's part of the club (and others if time permits) get to perform. People in the club also get opportunities to be part of IIITB Foundation day, infin8, Spandan and convocation.

Being a part of the club is a wonderful opportunity to meet people equally passionate as you, people with varied tastes in music and people who might give you a new perspective in the way you look at music. Those late night jamming sessions and musical nights will be totally worth the time you invest.

## Comic Club

People of the world unite! Gather around and share creativity! The Comic Club is a bunch of geeks who love TV shows, movies, anime or any other creative medium for that matter. Our love exists beyond that of simply consuming the media and since our inception we have made some fantastic comic strips which have been published in 8bit, our college magazine and organised Graffiti walls every now and then so that students can showcase their talent on an open platform. We have also been conducting League of Fanatics in our college fest, infin8 which is considered as one of the most anticipated events at IIITB. Not to forget those nights when we sat down for hours discussing anime, mangas, movies etc!

So, if you also share the same interests then...

Hop in, Let's have a great time together!

## Cite.

Cite. (Previously ISoClub) - Curating Ideas, Technology & Entertainment.

The club took its present form this April with an aim to make the campus, a stage for active participation and a hotbed of innovative ideas, as well as a platform for discussing the existing ones, old and up and coming through meetings, discussions, presentations and debates on a regular basis. And do not discount on the fun part, our little chats on Sci-Fi movies, music trends, anime etc. will surely act as a stressbuster. Make way for all kinds of discussions, even the crude ones. It will make way for sophisticated ones…

REMEMBER: It never starts with a sophisticated one!!!

These projects are funded and mentored by the college.

Our aim is to unite passionate developers and provide them a platform to collaborate and innovate with other geeky folks and to establish a community that promotes a Do-It-Yourself culture and quench your thirst for knowledge. You can get your idea and collaborate with people with the appropriate skill set for your ideas.

## Aikyam

Aikyam is the social wing of IIITB that was started in 2008 by the students of IIITB. It is an initiative taken to help the poor and the needy and understand our <strong>social responsibility</strong>.
 
What we do as part of Aikyam is, plan ‘Aikyam Trips’ to visit orphanages occasionally and spend our day with the children there. We usually collect funds from the students in college before any trip. We buy the necessary items for the children there and also give the funds collected to the orphanage. We generally visit the ‘<a href="http://www.desiresociety.org/" target="_blank">Desire Society</a>’ - which is a home for HIV affected kids (aged between 3-15) and ‘Swanthana’ - which is a home for mentally and physically challenged girls. Apart from this, frequently we collect articles like clothes, food and books from the students and donate them to the needy. For example, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1165116266895953&id=130926363648287" target="_blank">last year on Eid</a>, we collected these articles and donated them to the <a href="http://goonj.org/page_id=22873/" target="_blank">Goonj society</a>. Also, we conduct activities in college to spread social awareness among the students. For example, we started two initiatives last year - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocJbYOnic60&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">The Little Things and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/Aikyam-130926363648287/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1170969112977335" target="_blank">The Tiny Tales</a>. The Little Things is an initiative where the students make a short video to convey their concern to protect the environment or to support a social cause. The Tiny Tales is another such event where the students write a line or two on what they think they can do for the society. And we organise events to raise funds for donation. One such event is putting up a lemonade stall or pani puri stall during the college fest. We also help in organising blood donation camps at our college.
 
Why we do all this is? We believe that ‘Unity is the secret of social progress, and service to society is the means to promote it’. We spread happiness and awareness. This is the place where we can do our bit for the society and be thankful for all that we have.  
 
We look forward to join more hands to make our society a happier place to live in. To send in your opinions on what you can do or share any idea on social responsibility or for more such social activities, do mail us at <a href="mailto:aikyam@iiitb.org" target="_blank">aikyam@iiitb.org</a>.
