# Clubs @ IIITB 

## Innovation Center

Innovation Studio is a student body, which was formalized in Feb, 2017, with the guidance of IIITB Innovation Center and IIITB Faculty. 


We started with an aim to foster creative thinking to deliver products that the society needs. We want to develop an ecosystem which provides students with a necessary platform to realize their ideas by utilizing the guidance provided by our faculty, alumni and the strong network of IIITB.


Our motto is to promote informal learning and unleash the latent technical and entrepreneurial spirit of IIITB.

## Music Club
Music club, as the name suggests, is pretty straightforward in its aims and objectives. If you are a singer, an instrumentalist or just a music enthusiast, you are welcome to join us.

Music club has been around for as long as the college has.We have had amazing people, with incredible passion and talent, enthrall us with their awesomeness.

We organise musical nights, where everyone who's part of the club (and others if time permits) get to perform. People in the club also get opportunities to be part of IIITB Foundation day, infin8, Spandan and convocation.

Being a part of the club is a wonderful opportunity to meet people equally passionate as you, people with varied tastes in music and people who might give you a new perspective in the way you look at music. Those late night jamming sessions and musical nights will be totally worth the time you invest.

## Comic Club
People of the world unite! Gather around and share creativity! There's no better way to spend your time than with your favorite TV, movie and manga characters! And hence, The Comic Club was formed. Since our inception, we have made some fantastic comic strips which have been published in 8bit, organized Graffiti walls every now and then so that students can showcase their talent on an open platform. We have been conducting League of Fanatics in the infin8 which is considered as one of the most anticipated events at IIITB. Not to forget those nights when we sat down for hours discussing anime, mangas, movies etc. So, if you also share the same interests then...

Hop in, unleash your creativity and let's have a great time together...
