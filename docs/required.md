There is an Airtel SIM card outlet near to the campus, students are
requested to get their SIM cards according to their preferences without
any worry of signal problems.

authorities some time to provide you with the necessary documents for
the same.

SBI, ICICI, HDFC, Indian Bank and AXIS Bank ATMs are located just outside the campus.

would not provide any further help in this matter.
